This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### A little about me:

* I am undertaking a science degree, majoring in biological sciences in the ecology/zoology pathway.
* I am taking STATS 220 because statistics can be extremely *useful* in my field.
* I am **interested** in learning about how content from this course can complement my other courses and be applicable in my future.
* My favourite animals are:
  1. **Dogs**
  2. [Kākāpōs](https://www.nzbirdsonline.org.nz/species/kakapo)
  3. Otters
