# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a science degree in biological sciences.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I think statistics can be extremely useful in my field.
- I am interested in learning about how content from this course can compliment my other courses and be applicable in my future.
